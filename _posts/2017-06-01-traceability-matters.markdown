DePaul University alumn, Brooke Kravitz, made good use of her senior thesis project by focusing on a topic that touches the lives of millions of people every day.  The topic is food traceability. It’s incredibly important for U.S. consumers to be able to access the origin of the food which they are consuming. Commercial food industries ought not to fear providing consumers with the facts and sources of their products.

Brooke Kravitz combines experimental illustrations, captivating imagery, and an overall inviting aesthetic that makes a complex topic worth exploring.

It’s almost impossible for the average U.S. consumer to have complete control over their food. Commercial growing, harvesting, processing, and distribution are highly complex operations mostly hidden away from the public. Through posters, animation, and booklets, Traceability attempts to track small bits of the commercial food industry and demonstrate how challenging it is to be informed. Food traceability is a crucial factor in other issues like nutrition, human and animal welfare, and sustainability. It’s time that the industry went opensource, making information more visible and operations more transparent. Bon appétit!
